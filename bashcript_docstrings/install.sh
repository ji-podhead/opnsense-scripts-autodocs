# Installs a package on the system.
# It checks if the package is a core package and if so, it checks if the core package is up-to-date.
# If the core package is not up-to-date, it exits and displays an error message.
# Otherwise, it installs the package using the `pkg` command and logs the output to a lockfile.
# After installation, it runs the `register.php` script to register the package and then runs `pkg autoremove` to remove any unnecessary packages.
