# script ppp-linkdown.sh
# ------------------------
#
# Handles the link down event for a PPP interface.
#
# It shuts down the PPP connection using `ngctl`.
# It performs different actions based on the address family:
#  - For inet, it disables IPv4 forwarding and routing, and removes the IPv4 address.
#  - For inet6, it disables IPv6 forwarding and routing, and removes the IPv6 address.
# It also logs the uptime of the PPP connection and updates the uptime log file.
#
# *Params*
#  - {1}: str
#       - The name of the PPP interface.
#  - {2} : str
#       - The address family (inet or inet6).
#
# *Notes*
#  - This script assumes that the necessary commands (`ngctl`, `ifctl`, `configctl`, `ppp-uptime.sh`) are available.
#  - The script uses the `/conf/${IF}.log` file to log the uptime of the PPP connection.
#  - The script uses the `/tmp/${IF}_uptime` file to store the uptime of the PPP connection.
