script resync.sh
---------------------------------------

Resynchronizes the OPNsense system with the latest configuration.

It uses the `register.php`script to perform the resynchronization and logs its actions to the `${LOCKFILE}` file.

*Notes*
 - Thisscript assumes that the necessary commands (`opnsense-version`, `register.php`) are available.
 - Thescript uses the `/usr/local/opnsense/scripts/firmware/config.sh` file to configure the OPNsense environment.
 - Thescript clears the `${LOCKFILE}` file before starting the resynchronization.
